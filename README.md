# PINDiode

PINDiode is software for using the xPIN + Sample and Hold + NI-6002 setup in ELI Beamlines, developed at ELI Beamlines.
It is based on [dash](https://dash.plotly.com/), is using [nidaqmx-python](https://dash.plotly.com/) as the driver for NI-6002 and heavily uses [dash bootstrap components](https://github.com/facultyai/dash-bootstrap-components).
